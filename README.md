##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project


After wanting to get the Tailwind V2 CSS colours into my ColorSlurp App https://colorslurp.com/ (Pro version - enables imports), I found the process a little more cumbersome than originally thought. So, I wanted to put together a collection of scripts to make life easier for anyone else wanting to put a whole palette of colours into the Apple Color Picker or ColorSlurp.

This little script will ask for an input JSON file, a target output location, and then output a converted CLR file into that folder.

The json2clr app is a compiled version from user eip and this GIST at [https://gist.github.com/eip/3837dfdaeb0326d44cf60c65f59e74c2](https://gist.github.com/eip/3837dfdaeb0326d44cf60c65f59e74c2)

##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

![Run JSONtoCLR](https://github.com/IORoot/macos__json2clr--convert/blob/4fc6d7e68141892e6c25a74370ba588231df0385/docs/video_jsontoclr.gif?raw=true)

###  3.1. <a name='DemoPalettes'></a>Demo Palettes

####  3.1.1. <a name='tailwind_v2.json'></a>tailwind_v2.json

This is an example source colour palette. You can add / remove colours or supply your own JSON file with your own palette.

####  3.1.2. <a name='tailwind_v2.clr'></a>tailwind_v2.clr

This is the resulting file once the tailwind_v2.json file is put into the json2clr.app program.
